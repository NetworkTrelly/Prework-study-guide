## Description

My motivation was the idea of succeeding. Small pieces of code at a time. I built this project for people like myself to showcase even with the smallest of experience, YOU TOO can create such a thing. I solved problems from understanding what behind the scens of a webpage. All the things i thought it was; its not. So much more to it. I can't even click on google anymore and unsee the working machine behind what I'm actually seeing! I learned Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Github. Dont worry those titles might seem like a bit much...That's what the website is for. Enjoy!

## Usage
Each of the sections on this website lists numerous details about the underlined subject. For example you can see HTML explains what the HEad Element contains, the CSS tab explains what a margin indicates, git tab gives you some commands that will also help you out. If you'd like Right-Click anywhere on the page, scroll down to 'Inspect' in this little window click on Console... you actually being informed on which topic you should learn first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
